    "longdescription": "The snippet editor started as a simple example UI plugin to demonstrate new features available to UI plugins. It has turned into a functionally useful plugin in its own right. The snippet editor allows you to write small bits of code that might not be big enough to warrant the effort of a full plugin but are long enough that you don't want to retype them every time in the python-console!\n\nAs an added bonus, all snippets are added to the snippets menu and hot-keys can be associated with them as they make use of the action system. All action-system items are also available through the command-palette (CTL/CMD-p).\n\n![](https://github.com/Vector35/snippets/blob/master/media/snippets.gif?raw=true)\n\n.",
